## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since I'm using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) it was a little challenge to write normal CSS. I'm using CSS custom properties for the firsttime. I think I have to learn how to structe CSS custom properties to use it efficiently. I also learned to convert px values to rem. I used only rem for all (font-size, padding, margin, ...)

### Continued development

I try to improve to use of CSS custom properties (nameing).

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://www.tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me wirte normal CSS.
